, I've created a new branch:- phase1. Please push you code to that first, and once everything's working fine, we'll merge it with the master branch.
To shift branches, simply do this on the terminal:
git checkout phase1

And when you push to this branch for the first time, you'll need to do this:- "git push origin phase1" , instead of the simple "git push". Only the first time!
